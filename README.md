### Hi there 👋

Hi, I’m Codingcat, a young programmer from Germany who likes to code stuff for the game Minecraft, build electronic projects with Arduino and is trying to have some fun while doing so!

- 😄 Hobbys: **Programming, playing Minecraft, building projects with Arduino**
- ✔️ I make Minecraft plugins, mods, datapacks and maps (the technical part, I totally suck at building) and Arduino projects!
- ⚡ Favorite languages: **Java, C#, JS/TS, C++**
- 🌱 Currently learning React, GLSL & Unity
- 🌐 Website / Blog: **https://codingcat2468.github.io**
- 🔧 Modrinth: **https://modrinth.com/user/codingcat**


Oh yeah, and I like cats 😸. And coding ⚡.\
Truly suprising, huh?
